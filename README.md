> *“Passionate about building tech that solves real-world problems — from system-level programming to mobile apps.”*

I enjoy exploring the entire software spectrum:  
🔹 Low-level algorithms and optimization in C  
🔹 Object-oriented design and game development in C#  
🔹 Data analysis and finance management apps in Python  
🔹 iOS apps with Swift and SwiftUI  
🔹 Preparing myself for a future in cybersecurity and systems engineering  

Beyond coding, I lead a vibrant tech community of 200+ students as GDSC EPITA organizer and love sharing knowledge through talks and workshops.
