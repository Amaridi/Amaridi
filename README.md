# üëã Hi there! I'm **Amar Idinarene**

**2nd-year Computer Science student @ EPITA (üá´üá∑) | Former Exchange Student @ San Francisco State University (üá∫üá∏)**

I‚Äôm passionate about crafting technology that solves real-world problems ‚Äî from low-level system programming in C to building sleek iOS apps in Swift. When I‚Äôm not coding, I organize the Google Developer Student Club at EPITA, bringing together a vibrant community of 200+ tech enthusiasts.

> *‚ÄúBuilding software that‚Äôs not only functional, but meaningful.‚Äù*

üíº **Actively seeking ‚Äî Software Engineering internships (Summer/Fall 2025)**, ideally in mobile development, cybersecurity, or systems engineering. Open to remote or onsite opportunities!
